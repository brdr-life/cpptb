# Ibex's UVM testbench on Verilator 5

`dv/uvm/core_ibex` is Ibex's real verification environment: a UVM testbench with
an interrupt agent, a debug agent, two memory-interface agents, an RVFI
scoreboard against Spike, and around 57 test classes. Upstream's
`yaml/rtl_simulation.yaml` names six simulators -- VCS, Questa, DSim, Riviera,
qrun, Xcelium -- and Verilator is not one of them.

**Status: the testbench builds and runs on Verilator 5.050.** UVM elaborates,
the factory resolves a test by name, the report server prints, and the base test
reaches its own argument checks.

```
UVM_INFO @ 0: reporter [RNTST] Running test core_ibex_base_test...
UVM_FATAL core_ibex_base_test.sv(110) @ 0: uvm_test_top [uvm_test_top]
  Please specify test binary by +bin=binary_name
```

That fatal is the testbench working: it is the check for a missing `+bin`.

## Why this matters here

Everything else in `experiments/open_core_ports` compares a cpptb port against
an upstream flow running the same stimulus. For flow 5, the riscv-dv random
programs, there was no upstream side to compare against, because the upstream
side is UVM and nothing local could run it. `ports/riscv_dv` says so in as many
words. This is that missing baseline.

## Building

```sh
python3 ../../fetch.py uvm_core     # Accellera's UVM, pinned in sources.toml
python3 build_tb.py --config small
```

`--jobs` defaults to half the cores. The C++ compile of UVM plus the design
peaks at well over a gigabyte per job, and `-j 12` on a 16 GB machine is killed
by the OOM reaper part way through. The finished binary is about 270 MB.

The sources come from upstream's own `ibex_dv.f` and `ibex_dv_defines.f`,
expanded rather than transcribed, and the parameters come from
`util/ibex_config.py` -- the same tool `scripts/compile_tb.py` calls -- with
`-pvalue+` translated to Verilator's `-G`. An upstream change to either is a
change in what gets built, not a silent divergence.

## What it took

Eleven source edits and two C++ shims. All of them are applied to copies under
`build/overlay/` by `build_tb.py`, never to the fetched tree, and every one is
an exact-text replacement: if upstream changes those lines the build stops with
a message naming the file instead of quietly building something else.

They fall into four groups.

### 1. lowRISC's DV code excludes itself under Verilator

`clk_rst_if.sv` wraps its UVM includes and imports in `` `ifndef VERILATOR ``,
so under Verilator the interface compiles without `` `DV_CHECK_FATAL `` and
fails at the first use of it. `prim_assert.sv` does the same thing in the RTL:
it includes the dummy assertion macros and, alone among its branches, does not
define `INC_ASSERT` -- which is what `unused_assert_connected` in
`prim_count.sv` lives inside, and what `core_ibex_tb_top.sv` drives
unconditionally.

Both guards date from when no open simulator could elaborate UVM. Removing the
first and matching the second is most of what "porting" meant here.

Two other `` `VERILATOR `` guards are deliberately left alone: `pins_if.sv`
picks a strength-free `assign`, which Verilator genuinely needs, and
`dv_fcov_macros.svh` sets `DV_FCOV_DISABLE_CP`. The second is the switch to
flip when functional coverage is wanted.

### 2. A genuine LRM violation upstream

IEEE 1800 13.2.2 makes it illegal to write an automatic task's output argument
after a timing control. `csr_rd_sub` and `mem_rd_sub` in `csr_utils_pkg.sv` do
exactly that: they hand their own output formals to `uvm_reg::read` inside a
`fork ... join_any; disable fork`. Verilator enforces the rule and the
commercial simulators do not.

The fix writes automatic locals inside the fork and copies them out once it has
joined, which is what the code already means -- the outer `join` guarantees the
fork has finished before the task returns. Changing the formals to `ref`, the
usual advice, was tried first: Verilator rejects that too, which looks like an
over-strict reading of the same clause.

`csr_utils_pkg.sv` is in the compile only because `push_pull_agent_pkg` imports
`dv_lib_pkg` which imports it. Nothing in `dv/uvm/core_ibex` names either task.

### 3. Verilator features and bugs

| What | Where | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clocking block with `default output negedge` | `irq_if.sv` | Event moved to `@(negedge clk)`; a write lands at the same edge |
| `force`/`release` inside an interface used as a virtual interface | `dv_macros.svh` | The two arms of `` `DV_CREATE_SIGNAL_PROBE_FUNCTION `` become a fatal; nothing in Ibex ever calls them |
| `$readmemh` into a class property | `core_ibex_base_test.sv` | Reimplemented with `$fscanf`, same load semantics |
| `event e = null;` fails to compile | `ibex_mem_intf_response_sequencer.sv` | Initialiser dropped; null is the default anyway |
| 1024-bit `uvm_hdl_data_t` used as a queue index | `core_ibex_test_lib.sv` | Narrowed with a part select |
| Covergroup transition bins over enum items | `core_ibex_fcov_if.sv` | **Not fixed.** See below |

The last four are Verilator bugs rather than missing features, and two announce
themselves as such: `event e = null` produces C++ with no matching `operator=`,
and the covergroup produces `%Error: Internal Error: AstNode is not of expected
type, but instead has type 'ENUMITEMREF'`. `int'(wide_value)` as a queue index
is a third -- it is another internal error, which is why the narrowing is a part
select and not a cast.

The `force`/`release` row is worth reading twice. Verilator represents a
forceable signal as `VlForceVec` and cannot build virtual-interface triggers for
one, so twelve signals in `core_ibex_dut_probe_if.sv` were errors at their
declarations. Every call site in the Ibex tree passes `SignalProbeSample`; the
force and release arms are dead code that cost the whole interface. They are
replaced by a fatal rather than deleted, so a future caller finds out.

### 4. The plumbing UVM needs and Verilator does not ship

`shims/uvm_dpi_verilator.cc` compiles UVM's vendor-neutral DPI -- reporting,
regex, and the plusarg list -- and supplies the HDL backend that `uvm_hdl.c`
refuses to pick, since it selects on `VCS`, `QUESTA` or `XCELIUM` and otherwise
stops at `#error "hdl vendor backend is missing"`. The backend here is plain
VPI, which is why the build passes `--vpi`: without it
`uvm_cmdline_processor` sees no arguments and `+UVM_TESTNAME` never reaches
`run_test()`.

`shims/date_c_linkage.cc` exists because `ibex_dv.f` lists a `.c` file and
Verilator compiles everything it is handed with `$(CXX)`, so `get_unix_timestamp`
came out name-mangled and the link failed.

### A trap worth knowing about

Verilator's skip-identical check hashes the command line and the files it read
last time. Neither notices when a source moves from the upstream tree into
`build/overlay/`, because an include path is not on the command line and the
upstream file has not changed. An overlay then silently has no effect and the
same error repeats, which reads exactly like the fix not working. The build
passes `--no-skip-identical`.

## What is not done

- **Functional coverage.** `--fcov` exists but Verilator 5.050 dies with an
  internal error on the FSM transition bins. The three fcov sources leave the
  compile by default and `DV_FCOV_DISABLE` is defined.
- **Assertions.** `prim_assert.sv` gives Verilator the dummy macros, so the
  design's SVA is compiled out. Upstream's flows run with assertions on, and
  they are part of what those flows check. Turning them on means finding out
  how much of lowRISC's SVA Verilator 5 accepts.
- **Running a test.** The testbench needs a program linked for core_ibex's map
  at `0x8000_0000`, not Simple System's `0x0010_0000`, so the programs in
  `ports/riscv_dv/build` cannot be used as they are. That is the next step, and
  it is what turns this from "builds and starts" into a usable baseline.

## Bugs worth reporting

Three Verilator internal errors, each with a small reproducer available from the
overlays: the covergroup transition bins over enum items, `int'()` on a wide
value used as a queue index, and `event e = null`. The `VlForceVec` virtual
interface restriction and the `ref`-argument reading of 13.2.2 are limitations
rather than crashes, but both are worth raising.

On the Ibex side, `core_ibex_tb_top.sv` drives `unused_assert_connected`
without the `` `ifdef INC_ASSERT `` that declares it, which breaks any tool
whose assertion macros are the dummy ones.
